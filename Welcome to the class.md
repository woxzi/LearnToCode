Welcome to the notes for Diego's programming lessons! The notes here will be organized into folders, but should also be viewable using the graph view in the bar on your left. Each of our Lessons are broken up into sections and tagged with #Lesson , so you should be able to filter on those in the graph view if desired.

Message Diego before joining classes, so that a schedule can be worked out that accommodates everybody. Before joining the classes, you'll want to [[Lesson 0 - Environment Setup|install visual studio]] and create a new project to work in.
