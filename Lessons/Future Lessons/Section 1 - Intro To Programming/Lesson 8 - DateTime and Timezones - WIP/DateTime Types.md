## Date and Time Types


## Standard DateTime Representation
Most APIs use [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) 

- 
- we need to cover datetimes
- cover parsing
- cover what UTC time is
- cover epoch time
- how c# views datetime
	- local time vs utc time
	- c# doesn't care about timezones, only that a timestamp is 'local'
