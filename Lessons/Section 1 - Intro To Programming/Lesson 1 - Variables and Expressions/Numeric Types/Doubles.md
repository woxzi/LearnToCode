Doubles are a signed, floating-point [numeric type](Numeric%20Types.md) used for storing decimal numbers. They can represent any decimal number in the approximate range $±5.0\ ×\ 10^{−324}$ to $±1.7\ ×\ 10^{308}$ 

This type is named 'double' because it uses double the normal space in memory for storing numbers with increased precision compared to a regular 'float' type.

Because it is a numeric type, doubles may use any of the operators available to [[Numeric Types]].
