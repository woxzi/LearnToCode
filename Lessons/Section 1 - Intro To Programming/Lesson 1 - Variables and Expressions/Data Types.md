[Click here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/built-in-types) for a full list of Primitive [Variable](Variables.md) Types in C#!

**Primitive types you need to learn and know when starting out:**
- **[bool](Booleans.md)** - *A 'True' or 'False' value, often represented as a 1 or 0 respectively*
- **[char](Characters.md)** - *A single letter/character*
- **[int](Integers.md)** - *An integer number*
- **[double](Doubles.md)** - *A decimal number*

NOTE: *Primitive types that are not in the above list are all variations on numeric types, which are intended to store numbers in different ways. These should be easy to understand once you know some more about code, so don't worry about these right now.*


**You will also want to know what the below complex types are:**
- [string](Strings.md)
- [object](Lesson%205%20-%20Objects%20and%20Methods.md)
