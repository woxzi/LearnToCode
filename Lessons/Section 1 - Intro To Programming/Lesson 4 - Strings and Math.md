This lesson will cover commonly used [[Math Functions|math]] and [[String Functions|string]] functions. These simple utilities allow for much quicker development of logic for interfaces and math concepts. Please review the two pages associated with this lesson before attempting the below exercises.

## Exercises

### Math Questions

***For the below problems, ask the user for a number. Store that number, and use it to calculate the values of the formulas below. Use the provided number instead of 'x', and round the result to the nearest 5 decimal places.***

1. $\lceil{x}\rceil$
2. $2x^4+3$
3. $3\sqrt{\lvert x \rvert}+5$
4. $\sum^{15}_{k=0} k$

### String Exercises

1. Get a string as input from the user. Print a string made up of the first 3 and last 3 characters of the user input. If the input string's length is less than 3, return an empty string instead.
2. Given any arbitrary list or array of strings (your choice), concatenate all strings in the list to a single string, where each component string is separated by the character `-`.
3. Get a string as input from the user. Print a string containing every even character in the user's input string.
4. Ask the user for a number. Calculate the average and sum of all digits in the string.
5. Get a string from the user. Print out a message stating whether or not the string was a palindrome. Assume an empty string is a palindrome.
	- A palindrome is a word that is the same when spelled backwards and forwards. For example, 'racecar' is a palindrome.
